/*
-The weather dashboard page will utilize a weather API to 
dynamically pull info and display on page
-A search request will have to be sent to the api
-Below this search bar there must be a recent history of cities selected
we need

--a function to call the api 
---this function must also contain a button listener for the search button

--a handler to sort through the data

--a function to search for a specific city and pull that information
---into a div
---specifically getting these items from the JSON 
----City name
----Temp
----Humidity

--a function that saves the cities previously called into local storage
---then allows these city buttons to be clicked later and pull the 
current weather for that city
